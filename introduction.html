            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp;Government schemes play a vital role in supporting citizens, particularly those facing economic hardship. These schemes provide financial assistance, essential services, and other benefits that can significantly improve people's lives. However, a critical challenge lies in ensuring that those eligible for these schemes are aware of them and have access to the application process. <br> <br>
            
                &emsp;This project aims to bridge this gap by identifying individuals currently availing government schemes in a specific area. The focus of this project is on AC Nagar, located in the SPSR Nellore District. Through a survey conducted across fifty households within the locality, the project seeks to gather data on the utilization of government schemes. <br> <br>
                
                &emsp;This initiative serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it provides valuable insights into the current reach of these programs within the target community. Secondly, by identifying those not currently benefiting from relevant schemes, the project can play a crucial role in raising awareness and promoting accessibility.

Both schemes are designed to promote higher education and reduce the economic burden on families, thereby contributing to the overall socio-economic development of the state.</p>
